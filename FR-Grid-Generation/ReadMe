This program will create the deformed grid. It will 
print the grid points and connectivity file as well as the
boundary conditions in one file. Moreover, in the other file,
we will print the solution points. The way this is printed is first
with the vertices of the element (so first 4 rows are the corner nodes
of the element) and then the next rows hold the solution points of the 
element (so if p=2, the next 9 points are the solution points, in their
correct order as they will be loaded into the higher order code)
